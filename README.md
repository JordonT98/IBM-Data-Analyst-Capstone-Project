### Collecting Data Using APIs
In this scenario, I collected job opening data for technologies like Java, Python, MySQL, C++, and C# using the GitHub Jobs API.
This included data collection through APIs and also involved web scraping techniques to gather additional relevant information. 
Following data collection, I explored the datasets to understand their structure and contents, facilitating further analysis.
