# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

### Scenario 1
In this scenario, I collected job opening data for technologies like Java, Python, MySQL, C++, and C# using the GitHub Jobs API.
This included data collection through APIs and also involved web scraping techniques to gather additional relevant information. 
Following data collection, I explored the datasets to understand their structure and contents, facilitating further analysis.

### Scenario 2

Data Wrangling techniques will be used to perform the following tasks:

Data wrangling techniques will be utilized to achieve the following tasks: Identifying duplicate rows in the dataset, 
removing duplicate rows from the dataframe, determining the number of missing values for all columns, 
obtaining the value counts for the "Employment" column, and normalizing the data using two existing columns.

### Scenario 3

In this assignment, I will plot a distribution curve and histogram, find the median and outliers of particular columns, 
compute the interquartile range, determine the upper and lower bounds, and explore correlations between numerical columns. 
Additionally, you will create a new dataframe.

### Scenario 4

In this assignment, you'll demonstrate your visualization skills using the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 dataset.
You'll create various plots including histograms, scatter plots, bubble plots, box plots, pie charts, bar charts, 
and stacked charts to illustrate the distribution, relationships, and counts of the data.
